Fact checking old sei material:

The docs claim association methods like hasOne will automatically create foreign key references with constraints.
This is not the case when using the sequelize-cli. Columns for associations must be added to the model.

Are static associate methods doing anything?
  Fuck yea. For the join to successful when using 'includes' you must define the association (hasOne, belongsTo, etc)

Can the cascade be left out of the static associate, and just included in model and migration?
  Hell yes. In fact, it makes more sense to take care of it there.

Test whether foreign key columns can be added with only the migration.
